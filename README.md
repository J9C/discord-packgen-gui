# Source Code
Basically this was made using PySimpleGUI, its pretty basic and simple I just created a textbox and some buttons, then I created the actual script using randit like in a POC, and then I used the random joke button by inputing a list of jokes and it will randomly give you one of the jokes that I inputed, if you realy want to see the source code for educational purposes or any other reasons you can ask for it by dm'ing me on twitter or discord
